Interventions -- properties and strategies in the game:
(I1) Interventions targeting the resource search mechanism (e.g. education) [pre] -- seeker strategies -- seeker with targeted search
(I2) Interventions targeting the research search cost (e.g. support payments) [during] -- seeker gas -- increase seeker gas
(I3) Interventions targeting the payoff (outcomes), e.g. vaccine push [post] -- seeker immunity -- increase immunity against lack of resources

Population:
(P1) Proportions of various groups: (P1-1) SEC groups (X% lower, Y% middle, Z% upper) and (P1-2) Ethnicity (White British + Ethnic Minority) -- gas levels
(P2) From within the 0-18 year old cohort, from within each SEC group, the prevalence of conditions relevant to the study: proportion with respiratory conditions (P2-1) and proportion with depression (P2-2) -- regular (non-immune) traversers
Permutations of the above.

Behaviours:
(B1) Uptake of targeted education -- % distribution between random and targeted (meta-strategy distribution)
(B2) Uptake of support payments -- % chance to use (additional) gas
(B3) Uptake of vaccines -- % chance to leverage (additional) resource immunity

Outcomes:
(O1) From within the 0-18 year old cohort, from within each SEC group, from those children with a given condition, what their current healthcare utilisation is -- mapped to payoff for relevant conditions
